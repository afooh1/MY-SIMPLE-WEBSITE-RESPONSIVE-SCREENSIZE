            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is Babatunde Olatunde, and I’m a web development enthusiast currently diving deep into Full Stack Web Development at Conestoga College in Ontario, Canada. I am from Lagos, Nigeria and I have a background in Computer Science from the University of Ilorin, Nigeria. I’m passionate about building modern, user-friendly websites.</p>
    
            <p>I love working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery, and I’m always eager to learn new frameworks and technologies. Right now, I’m focused on creating engaging, accessible, and responsive web applications.</p>

            <p>Beyond coding, I enjoy problem-solving, collaborating on projects, and exploring creative UI/UX design. I’m currently working on projects like an Art Gallery website and an online game shop called "Game One."</p>

            <p>When I’m not coding, I enjoy discovering new music, watching football, plane spotting, flying drones, and spending time with loved ones.</p>

            <p>My favorite quote is one I learned from my brother-in-law: "Life is a journey, and we will all get to our destination with time." With this in mind, I believe I can bring ideas to life, one line of code at a time.</p>
